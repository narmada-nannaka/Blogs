## Now, what is this chatter about AWS?

AWS Stands for Amazon Web Services. It is one of the leading providers that offer on-demand IT services that you can pay for as you go on the internet. Compared to the traditional on-premise hosting, AWS services will be on the cloud (internet) and are:

- Highly reliable
- Easy to scale
- Inexpensive

When you sign up for AWS, you will not require to sign any lock-in contracts. Or, you do not have to make any huge infrastructure investments beforehand.

If you look at IT as a series of actions, you will notice some common undifferentiated tasks that are applicable to any company. Tasks such as networking of all types, storage and compute are usually undertaken by the IT department of the company. Now, AWS does all the heavy-lifting to complete these tasks.

The best part is, it offers 150+ unique services and they can be added with a click of a button. Some of the services are AWS high-level security, Database as a service, Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and Identity management.

Well, it can be daunting to start building on top of a new platform using some new services. For this reason, AWS offers a wide range of on-demand solutions with pay by hour option through its Marketplace. And, there is the Amazon Partner Network (APN) that assists with developing solutions and services by leveraging Amazon Web Services.

### Why AWS? Why not others?

True, there are other players in the market who also offer a similar cart of solutions and services as AWS. But the one key difference is that Amazon Web Services is on its own scale far above the other cloud providers with its offerings. The latest Gartner report, 2020 Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure &amp; Platform Services supports this and places Amazon Web Services at the top as a leader in its report.
