## Design that matters

When designing websites and web applications, most of the designers focus on the logic and the purpose of the websites, but there is one more thing that has to be given priority from the start itself that is the design of the website. The display and the presentation matter the most when it comes to attracting more traffic to your site. However, there are arguments from some of the experts stating that the purpose of the website should meet the needs of the user. Today the business market has grown and there are very unique businesses that are being provided to the users. So, when there a number of companies trying to meet the same customer needs, there is no point in just considering the business logic as the focus of developing the websites, the companies have to focus on attracting the users with their unique presentation of information to the users.

The design alternatives should be given enough preference and thought around the aspects of being adaptable for mobile users and flexible to add additional features later in the future. There are many websites providing tips about how to design websites best. This post will not be providing any such tips, because today you can Google any code needed for designing the websites, but what is needed is how to step forward in the designing process of websites.

Step 1: Be clear

The purpose of the website, its requirements, and what the users will be doing on the website should be clearly understood. This is the big picture for your website. Try to think of what is important and what is not, based on this try to differentiate the information available such as the important information and the functionality is highlighted on the website and the rest will be present but not in the spotlight. Consider a company selling spare parts for automobiles, if it highlights on careers link, there is no point in that, but a careers agent has to highlight the careers link. Thatâ€™s how clear the information has to be addressed according to the needs and the purpose of the user. Spare some time on which group of users will be mostly using the website, depending on this information the display can be planned for the website as well.

Step 2: Choose the Best

Come up with alternatives to the design that best addresses the requirements of the users. However go through each alternative and check which could grab the attention of the users, takes less bandwidth and time to load. Consider running trials on a few of your friends or colleagues on showing them the layouts of the website design and choose the best one that meets the purpose.

Step 3: KISS (keep it simple and stupid)

Yes, keep it as simple as you can with your code, such that the aspects of bandwidth and transmission time goals can be met through this. Moreover donâ€™t stress the coding much, because meeting the business objectives is important. Do not lose your focus from business to technology. It is really to get lost that way, it happens to me always. After 2 days of enough stress, I ask the question do I really need this part, can this be done any other way? So, donâ€™t get to this point. Stay focused on the main thing but not the side things.

Through this post these are the steps I want you to consider before designing websites, I donâ€™t drag 3 steps would do ðŸ™‚
