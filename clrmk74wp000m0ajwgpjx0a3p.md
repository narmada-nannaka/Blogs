Are you gearing up to enter the world of Azure Certifications? If so, AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals is the first step to gaining general knowledge in the cloud and Azure in particular.

This certification tests your knowledge of Azure architectural components and services, such as computing, networking, and storage domains. To gain the certification, you need to demonstrate you are knowledgeable in the following skills:

* Describe cloud concepts (25–30%)
    
    * Describe cloud computing
        
    * Describe the benefits of using cloud services
        
    * Describe cloud service types
        
* Describe Azure architecture and services (35–40%)
    
    * Describe the core architectural components of Azure
        
    * Describe Azure compute and networking services
        
    * Describe Azure storage services
        
    * Describe Azure identity, access and security
        
* Describe Azure management and governance (30–35%)
    
    * Describe cost management in Azure
        
    * Describe features and tools in Azure for governance and compliance
        
    * Describe features and tools for managing and deploying Azure resources
        
    * Describe monitoring tools in Azure
        

Once you are ready to get certified, the exam can be scheduled through Pearson VUE or Certiport. The exam is scored on a scale of 1 to 1000 and requires 700 or more to pass. Please note that 700 does not mean 70% - it is based on the competence shown in answering the questions and the difficulty of the questions.

The exam is 45 minutes long, and it is recommended to allocate 65 minutes for the overall process. Typically, Microsoft certification exams contain 40-60 multiple-choice questions, and since this is a fundamental exam, the total question count is expected to be on the lower end.
